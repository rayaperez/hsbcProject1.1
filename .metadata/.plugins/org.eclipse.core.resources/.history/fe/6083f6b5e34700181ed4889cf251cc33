Feature: Instrument List
   As HSBC user
   In order to review all valid trades
   I want to receive the list of the instruments that are trades or not between the given dates
   
   
  Scenario Outline: List of the instruments
      Given I have the list of the instruments as
      | instid   | <id>    |
      | instname | <name>  |
      
      And the trades list is
      | TradeID     | <TradeID>     |
      | TradeDtTime | <TradeDtTime> |
      | InID        | <InID>        |
      | qty         | <qty>         |
      | price       | <price>       |
      | amount      | <amount>      |
      | trader      | <trader>      |
      

      When I search for the date range from "<dateRangeFrom>" and to "<dateRangeTo>"
      Then I receive the list with all the trades marked if they in or out of this range
       
       Examples: 
       | dateRangeFrom | dateRangeTo |
       | 29/11/2017    | 30/11/2017  |
       | 29/11/2016    | 30/11/2016  |
       
       Examples:
       | id     | name          |
       | IN1    | Shares Google |
       | IN2    | Shares IBM    |
       | IN3    | Shares XYZ    |
       
       Examples:
       | TradeId | TradeDtTime         | InID | qty | price | amount | trader  |
       | T1      | 30/11/2017 23:11:01 | IN1  |100  | 12    | 1200   | TRADER1 |
