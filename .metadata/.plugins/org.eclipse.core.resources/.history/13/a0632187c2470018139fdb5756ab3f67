Feature: Instrument Not Traded Between the given dates.

  Scenario Outline: Untraded Instruments
    Given I have an instrument list 
    | instid | instname      |
    | IN1    | Shares Google |
    | IN2    | Shares IBM    |
    | IN3    | Shares XYZ    |
    And List of trades list
    | TradeId | TradeDtTime | InID     | qty | price | amount | trader  |
	| T1      | 30/11/2017  | 23:11:01 | IN1 | 100   |12,1200 | TRADER1 |
    When I search for the trades for the dates ranges  <dateFrom> and <dateTo>
    Then I receive the list of all the transactios that are not traded between those dates
    
    Examples: 
    | dateFrom   | dateTo       |
    | 30/01/2017 | 30/03/2017   |
    | 30/01/2016 | 29/11/2017   |
